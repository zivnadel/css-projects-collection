# css-projects-collection

This repository contains a few of the project I made while enhancing my basic-CSS skills, using technologies like Flexbox and Grid System, responsive layouts and media-queries, css animations (keyframes, transitions and more) and more.

The websites in this repo are constructed from simple HTML pages, and the focus is the styling. You can easily run each site by downloading it files and opening the `index.html` file via the browser.

You can also view all the sites and pages [at this link](https://zivnadel.github.io/css-projects-collection/).
